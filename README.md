# survey-form
## About the project 📗

Compass UOL challenge that consists of responsive layouts specifically for layouts with a width of 1280px (DESKTOP) and 480px (MOBILE).
In the challenge, on the input screens, the User, when clicking the "next" button without selecting the input[radio]/input[checkbox] and select options, should be prevented from advancing to the next screen unless they click the "skip" button. The challenge also includes form validation, where the User can only "Submit" when the form fields are filled.

## 🚀 Features

- ⭐ Feature 1: When selecting input[radio]/input[checkbox] and select, the User, when clicking "Next," goes to the next screen.
- ⭐ Feature 2: Form validation, where the User can only "Submit" when the form fields are filled.
- ⭐ Feature 3: Responsiveness for Desktop/Mobile/Tablet.
- ⭐ Feature 4: Store field values in Local Storage.

## What I learned ?💡

- ✨ Pixel Perfect: I learned that we should care about and value the composition of the entire layout, respecting its widths/heights, font sizes, font weights, etc.
- ✨ Mobile First: Until then, I had already done 2 projects with mobile first, and with this one, I was able to learn even more.
        - Project instructors advised starting with Mobile First. I decided to step out of my comfort zone, which was starting the project for larger screens, and in the end, I only gained. It is very rewarding the knowledge gained throughout the project.
- ✨ Form Validation: I learned another way to validate forms, among many others.
- ✨ More JS knowledge: How to get input value and change pages.
        - Note: To change pages, the instructor's recommendation was to create a page routing with VanillaJS.

        - I didn't have time to apply it because I believed it would be complex and I would be copying code that I wouldn't know its function.
- ✨ Efficient code documentation.
- ✨ Code standardization in classes.
- ✨ Store field values in Local Storage.

## ⚒️ Installation

Steps to install and set up your project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/xmurilo/survey-form.git

     ```bash
     cd survey-form

3. **Open the project in your browser:**
        
        Open the pagina-1.html file in your preferred browser.
        
     ```bash
        ├── survey-form
                ├── css/
                ├── imgs/
                ├── js/
                ├── pagina-1.html
                ├── pagina-2.html
                ├── pagina-3.html
                ├── pagina-4.html
                ├── ....

4. **NOTE: Or you can run the command in the terminal to open the project:**
Make sure you are inside the project directory!
     ```bash
        start pagina-1.html

5. **Now you can navigate through the project and see how it works.**
6. **Editing and Customization:**
Feel free to make edits to the HTML, CSS, and JS files to customize the project according to your needs.

## What can I improve?  🔧

- When the project reached the logical part, I had difficulties, not because of the logic itself, but which methods I could use to implement the logic. For example, "How do I get the value of the input to check if it is 'checked'?" "How do I change pages using JS?" I had these questions, and I think I need to improve in this area as soon as possible, either by doing challenges or delving into the documentation.
- In the middle of the project, I got a bit lost in terms of code organization. I believe I can improve on that.
- Mobile First, even though I did it in mobile first, I believe I can further improve by using this concept.
- I should pay attention to which HTML tags can be nested inside another tag.

That's it, I'm very happy to have completed the challenge. I thought I wouldn't be able to, but I tried my best. Tips, corrections, constructive criticism, etc., are always welcome. I believe that with that, we can only add value.
